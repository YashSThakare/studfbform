    <h1> My Course Understanding</h1>
    <p>This course taught me basic to advanced level of programming languages like C, Java, HTML, CSS, JS and their fundamentals. It also taught me Software Development Life Cycle Methodologies which describes different types of approaches for software development or a certain project just like this. SDLC methodologies helps complex projects break down into small and simple problems and thus making sure the project is complete and the results are achieved. Intensively in C programming this course taught me functions, variables, pointers, structures, etc. And towards the end of this course I achieved enough skills to be able to take a responsibility and develop a software or a project with all the fundamentals in place.</p>
