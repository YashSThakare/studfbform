    <h1>My JS Understanding</h1>

    <h4>JavaScript is crucial for adding dynamic behavior, validation, and interactivity to the form. Here's how it is used:</h4>
    <p>1. Form Validation:
        Before submitting the form, JavaScript makes sure that user inputs fulfill certain requirements. JavaScript validation rules, for instance, can determine whether the first name, middle initial, and last name only contain alphabetic letters.
        Only numbers make up the matriculation number, the email field is formatted correctly, and all mandatory fields are filled in.
        For validation, why use JavaScript? Basic validation is provided by the HTML pattern and necessary attributes, but JavaScript enables dynamic feedback based on user input and configurable error messages.
    </p>
    <p>2. Event Handling:
        JavaScript is capable of managing a number of user interactions, such as listening for the submit event to carry out validation or initiate activities prior to the form being submitted.
        By giving consumers immediate feedback while they enter or choose alternatives, it improves usability.
    </p>
    <p>3. Redirection:
        Using functions like window.location.href, JavaScript may reroute viewers to a "Thank You" page following a successful submission.</p>

    <h4>Inline HTML Validation vs. JavaScript Validation</h4>
        <p>1. Why Inline HTML Validation is Easier:
            Simplicity - Without creating additional JavaScript code, quick implementation is possible by utilizing HTML properties like pattern, needed, and type.
            Browser Support - Custom scripts are not as necessary because HTML validation elements are natively supported by modern browsers.
            Maintenance - Because the validation algorithm is linked to particular input items, inline validation is simpler to maintain for small-scale applications.</p>

    <p>2. When to Use JavaScript Validation
        Advanced Validation - For more intricate needs, such comparing fields (like confirming a password) or verifying formats that go beyond simple patterns.
        Custom Error Messages - To replace standard browser messages with feedback that is easy to understand.
        To guarantee consistent behavior across earlier browsers that might not completely implement HTML5 validation, cross-browser compatibility is necessary.</p>
    
    <p>Conclusion:
    For this project, I have used HTML inline validation which is more practical because the requirements are straightforward, and the code remains simpler and easier to maintain. JavaScript can be added later for advanced functionality or dynamic interactions if needed.</p>
