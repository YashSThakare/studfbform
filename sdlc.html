    <h1>My Understanding About SDLC Methodologies</h1>
    <h2>SDLC Methodologies in Reference To My Webpage:</h2>
    <h4>1. Waterfall Model</h4>
        <p>Each step of the Waterfall methodology—requirement collection, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance—is finished in order in this linear approach to software development.
        The relevance to our Project is using the Waterfall method, we would have clearly stated specifications for the functionality and form fields up front. Finished designing the form's user interface and user experience before putting it into use. Prior to deployment, a dedicated phase could have been used to test the form's functionality (validation, responsiveness, and interaction).</p>
    <p>Benefit: The procedure is simple and guarantees that no stage is repeated.</p>
    <p>Limitation: Insufficient adaptability in the event that requirements change while development is underway.</p>
        
    <h4>2. Agile Approaches </h4>
        <p>Agile is an iterative methodology that prioritizes incremental delivery, ongoing feedback, and teamwork.
        The relevance to our Project is using Agile the project may have been divided into sprints, each of which would have focused on a different feature (for example, form fields in one sprint, validation in another, and design in a third).
        After every sprint, user or peer feedback can be gathered to improve the features.</p>
        <p>Benefit: Enables adaptability and ongoing development.</p>
        <p>Limitation: Needs regular cooperation and can get out of control if not managed well.</p>
        
    <h4>3. The DevOps </h4>
        <p>Continuous integration and deployment are made possible by DevOps, which blends development and operations. An important part of DevOps is automation.
        The relevance to our Project is in a DevOps environment after each update, the form might be automatically deployed on a server or hosting platform using tools like CI/CD pipelines.
        Ongoing observation would guarantee that any mistakes (such as malfunctioning validations or improper layouts) are found and corrected as soon as possible.
        Version control and automated testing could be accomplished with the help of programs like GitHub Actions.</p>
        <p>Benefit: Ensures rapid upgrades by streamlining deployment and monitoring.</p>
        <p>Limitation: Extra setup and infrastructure knowledge could be needed.</p>
</p>
        
    <p>Each SDLC approach has benefits and works well for different kinds of projects. Because it allows for incremental improvements, especially as we modify the design and interactivity in response to user feedback, agile is a logical choice for this form. Waterfall may, however, also work effectively for a small-scale, precisely defined project like this one due to its simplicity. DevOps would be more suitable if the form were a part of a larger system that required frequent delivery and modifications.</p>

    <h2> Agile SDLC Methodologies:</h2>
    <p>1. Scrum: Scrum is a well-known Agile methodology in which work is broken down into sprints, which are fixed-length iterations that typically last one to four weeks. Developers, Product Owners, and Scrum Masters are among the positions that make up a Scrum team. To guarantee development and flexibility, regular meetings are conducted, such as sprint reviews and daily stand-ups.
        Application to the Project:

        A Scrum strategy for this form might include:
        Sprint 1: Creating the form's fundamental HTML layout framework.
        Sprint 2: Using JavaScript to implement form validation and interaction.
        Sprint 3: Using CSS to improve the design and taking user input into consideration. During evaluations, regular feedback loops would aid in the form's gradual improvement. 
</p>
        
    <p>2. Kanban: Kanban emphasizes efficiency, work-in-progress limitation, and workflow visualization. On a Kanban board, tasks are tracked in columns labeled "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
        Application to the Project:

        The project tasks (such as establishing the form structure, adding validation, and enhancing design) would be monitored on a board using Kanban. Without overworking themselves, developers could concentrate on doing one task at a time, guaranteeing a consistent and efficient workflow.
</p>
        
    <p>3. Extreme Programming (XP)
        Through techniques like continuous integration, pair programming, and test-driven development (TDD), XP places a strong emphasis on technical excellence and regular releases. It emphasizes client happiness and simplicity.
        Application to the Project:

        To make sure the form functions as intended, developers could create automated tests for the validation features.
        Key features like design or validation could be jointly developed via pair programming.
        The modifications would be guided by stakeholder feedback and frequent deployments.
</p>
        
    <p>Advantages of Agile Methodologies:
        <p>Scrum: Ideal for well-organized teamwork with distinct roles and sprint objectives.</p>
        <p>Kanban: Perfect for enhancing job efficiency and process visualization without rigid sprint cycles.</p>
        <p>XP: Ideal for applications that call for quick iterations and superior technical performance.</p>
